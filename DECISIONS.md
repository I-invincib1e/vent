# Architecture Decision Records

This log records consequential technical and product decisions made while building Vent — the *why*
behind the code, not just the *what*. Format: one entry per decision, dated, with context, the decision
itself, and its consequences/tradeoffs. New entries are appended as the project evolves; existing entries
are never rewritten (if a decision is later reversed, add a new entry that supersedes it and says so).

Loosely follows the [Architecture Decision Record](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
pattern popularized by Michael Nygard.

## ADR-001 — Self-hosted pipeline over a managed voice-agent platform
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** Managed platforms (Vapi, Retell, ElevenLabs Agents) offer faster setup for voice agents but
put the operator's prompts, call data, and per-minute cost structure inside someone else's product, with
whatever roadmap and pricing changes that platform decides on.

**Decision:** Build Vent as infrastructure the operator owns end to end — Twilio, Deepgram, the LLM, and
the TTS engine wired directly, with our own database for calls/transcripts, not a third party's dashboard.

**Consequences:** More setup work and more moving pieces to maintain (three-plus vendor integrations
instead of one platform SDK), but full control over cost, data residency, prompt/tool logic, and the
ability to swap any single layer (see ADR-002, ADR-005) without being blocked by a platform's feature
gaps. This tradeoff is explicit in the product's own positioning ("your infrastructure, your rules").

## ADR-002 — Cartesia as the default TTS provider, ElevenLabs kept as an option
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** A real outbound test call went completely silent after connecting. Investigation found
ElevenLabs' free tier returns `402 payment_required` ("Free users cannot use library voices via the API")
for every voice in the account, regardless of which voice ID is configured — this isn't a bug in our code,
it's an ElevenLabs account-tier restriction that can't be worked around without upgrading to a paid plan.

**Decision:** Add Cartesia as a second TTS provider behind a shared `ConnectTts` interface
(`voice/tts/types.ts`), and make it the default (`TTS_PROVIDER=cartesia`) since it works on a free/Starter
plan with no equivalent restriction, and it natively outputs `pcm_mulaw` at 8000Hz — the exact format
Twilio's Media Streams need, with zero re-encoding, matching the same zero-conversion path ElevenLabs
already had.

**Consequences:** ElevenLabs remains fully supported for anyone with a paid plan (`TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs`)
— this wasn't a replacement, it was adding optionality the user explicitly asked for ("we will add more
providers"). The provider abstraction this required (rather than a hardcoded ElevenLabs call) is now the
template every future TTS/LLM provider follows.

---

## ADR-003 — Compliance is enforced by default, not left as an integration step
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** The user explicitly asked for compliance (TCPA, DNC, consent, HIPAA, GDPR) that "runs itself"
— the developer adopting this repo shouldn't have to remember to wire in a DNC check or a recording
disclosure; those are exactly the kind of steps that get skipped under deadline pressure and turn into
real legal exposure once calls are actually placed at volume.

**Decision:** Every outbound call automatically passes through a Do-Not-Call check and a TCPA
calling-window check before dialing (`voice/compliance/`, wired directly into
`POST /calls/outbound`) — a call that fails either check is rejected with a clear reason and never reaches
Twilio. The recording/AI disclosure is spoken at the start of every call by default
(`RECORDING_DISCLOSURE_ENABLED=true` is the default, not opt-in).

**Consequences:** A developer who does nothing beyond setting up API keys still gets baseline TCPA/consent
behavior. The tradeoff is that these checks add a small amount of unavoidable overhead/latency to every
outbound call, and the calling-window timezone inference is best-effort (area-code-based), not perfectly
precise — documented as such rather than presented as legally airtight.

---

## ADR-004 — HIPAA support is a guardrail, not a certification
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** HIPAA compliance legally requires a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) between the
covered entity and every vendor that touches PHI — Twilio, Deepgram, the TTS provider, the LLM provider.
No code running in this repo can verify that a BAA actually exists; that's a contract, not a technical
state.

**Decision:** Rather than silently assume compliance or omit HIPAA support entirely, add a
`COMPLIANCE_MODE=hipaa` flag that makes the server **refuse to boot** unless the operator also sets
`HIPAA_BAA_CONFIRMED=true` — a deliberate human checkpoint. This is documented explicitly, in both the
README and the code comments, as a guardrail against the failure mode of "nobody actually checked," not a
claim that setting the flag makes the deployment HIPAA-compliant.

**Consequences:** This adds friction (a mode that won't start without an extra flag) by design. It does
not, and cannot, replace actually signing BAAs or a real compliance review — that responsibility stays with
the operator. The same honesty principle applies to GDPR: only the concretely codeable pieces (retention
limits, right-to-erasure) are automated; a legal basis for processing is still the operator's
responsibility.

---

## ADR-005 — Groq added as a swappable LLM provider behind the same pattern as TTS
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** The user asked specifically about using Groq for lower latency/cost. Research confirmed LLM
inference is typically the single largest latency contributor in a voice pipeline (larger than STT or
TTS), and Groq's LPU-based inference is a commonly cited fix for exactly this bottleneck in real-time voice
agents.

**Decision:** Add Groq via the official `@ai-sdk/groq` package as a second LLM provider
(`voice/llm/`), selected via `LLM_PROVIDER=groq`, mirroring the TTS provider-abstraction pattern from
ADR-002 rather than hardcoding a second code path. Added time-to-first-token telemetry per turn so the
latency claim can be measured on real calls instead of assumed.

**Consequences:** The AI Gateway path remains the default (`LLM_PROVIDER=gateway`) since it's what the
platform provisions out of the box; Groq requires the user to supply their own `GROQ_API_KEY`. No
production call has yet been run with Groq active — this decision is recorded, but the latency claim is
not yet empirically verified in this deployment (tracked as an open item).

---

## ADR-006 — Workflows as code-first JSON config, not a visual builder
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** The user asked for Shopify-flow-style call automation (trigger → branch on outcome → action).
Competitor platforms (Retell, ElevenLabs Agents) increasingly offer visual graph-based workflow builders,
but Vent has no dashboard/UI by explicit earlier product decision.

**Decision:** Define workflows as a JSON array (`WORKFLOWS` env var) mapping call outcomes to actions
(retry/webhook/addToDnc/sendSms-stub), executed by a small engine (`voice/workflows/engine.ts`) and a
background scheduler for delayed retries (`scheduler.ts`).

**Consequences:** No visual editing — changing a workflow means editing an env var and restarting. This
matches the rest of Vent's "edit code/config, not a dashboard" philosophy, but is a real limitation for a
non-technical operator. A visual workflow builder is flagged as a natural v3 direction if the product ever
needs to serve non-developer users directly.

---

## ADR-007 — National DNC Registry integration deferred; internal list is the enforced mechanism today
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** Research confirmed there is no free public API for the FTC's National Do-Not-Call Registry —
real-time or bulk lookups require a paid Subscription Account Number (SAN) obtained through
telemarketing.donotcall.gov. This is a purchasing decision for the operator, not something the codebase can
resolve unilaterally.

**Decision:** Build and fully enforce an internal DNC list (`voice/compliance/dnc.ts`,
`doNotCall` table) automatically on every outbound call today. Design the check function and schema
(`source: "manual" | "agent" | "national-registry"`) so that syncing the national registry in later is a
pure data-population problem, not a code change — the enforcement path already treats all three sources
identically.

**Consequences:** Out of the box, Vent only blocks numbers the operator has explicitly added (manually, or
automatically via a workflow's `addToDnc` action). It does **not** currently prevent calling numbers
registered on the national registry unless the operator manually adds them — this is a known gap,
documented in the README's "Known limitations," not silently glossed over.

---

## ADR-008 — Public endpoint via a free Cloudflare quick-tunnel is a temporary stopgap, not a solution
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** Discovered that this platform's own public preview URL doesn't pass through WebSocket upgrade
requests (`502` on any `Upgrade: websocket` header, confirmed even on plain routes) — a hard requirement
for Twilio Media Streams. A Cloudflare quick-tunnel (`cloudflared tunnel --url ...`, no account needed) was
stood up as a workaround, and it already dropped once mid-test (`"no recent network activity"` in tunnel
logs), independent of anything in the application code.

**Decision:** Use the quick-tunnel to unblock real-call testing in the short term, but explicitly document
it as unfit for anything beyond occasional manual testing — not a production access path.

**Consequences:** Any further live-call testing inherits this instability until resolved. Two real fixes
are on the table (recorded as an open decision, not yet made): (1) an authenticated Cloudflare named
tunnel (still free, requires a Cloudflare account + domain, far more stable), or (2) deploying the server
to a persistent host outside this sandbox with its own stable domain. This ADR exists so the tradeoff isn't
forgotten or mistaken for a solved problem in future work.

---

## ADR-009 — Evaluated and rejected LiveKit Agents as an orchestration layer
**Date:** 2026-07-04

**Context:** After market research showed Vent's STT→LLM→TTS orchestration isn't novel (Pipecat, LiveKit
Agents, TEN Framework, and Vocode all solve this with bigger plugin ecosystems and more production
mileage), the idea of adopting one of these frameworks instead of maintaining Vent's own hand-rolled
pipeline was raised and investigated. LiveKit Agents was the strongest candidate — it ships an official
TypeScript SDK (matching Vent's Bun/TypeScript stack, unlike Pipecat which is Python-only server-side) and
has documented Twilio integration patterns.

Deeper investigation surfaced two disqualifying problems:
1. **Both LiveKit deployment options reintroduce the exact dependency Vent exists to remove.** LiveKit
   Cloud puts a third-party vendor between the operator and their own calls — the black-box-platform
   pattern Vent's positioning argues against, plus another account/API-key set every adopter would need.
   Self-hosted LiveKit requires running a media server (SFU) + Redis for room-state coordination, meets
   LiveKit's own recommended baseline of 4 CPU cores / 8GB RAM per agent server, and needs a domain + SSL
   certificate + Docker/Kubernetes — a large new operational burden for every person who adopts Vent, the
   opposite of the "less hustle for our users" goal.
2. **Architectural mismatch with Twilio.** Vent's current pipeline uses Twilio Media Streams, a
   WebSocket-based audio bridge. LiveKit's telephony model is WebRTC + SIP trunking — a different
   transport entirely. Twilio's own support docs confirm they do not offer a SIP-over-WebSocket endpoint,
   so bridging the two requires an extra translation layer (Twilio → SIP trunk → LiveKit dispatch rules →
   LiveKit room); public GitHub issues describe this specific bridge behaving unreliably in production.

**Decision:** Reject adopting LiveKit Agents (or any hosted/self-hosted orchestration framework) for
Vent's core pipeline. Keep and continue hardening the existing direct Twilio Media Streams + Deepgram +
swappable-LLM + swappable-TTS pipeline, which is already built, already proven on a real call, and
requires no infrastructure beyond the API providers a user already needs.

**Consequences:** Vent will not benefit from Pipecat's/LiveKit's larger plugin ecosystems or their ongoing
engineering investment in raw pipeline features (turn-detection tuning, WebRTC transport optimizations,
etc) — that tradeoff is accepted deliberately. The "leverage" identified in earlier research (that no
competitor, hosted or open-source, ships automatic compliance/workflows/control) remains the correct place
to invest instead, since it doesn't require adopting anyone else's infrastructure to build. This decision
supersedes the direction implied by the (unexecuted) LiveKit migration plan from earlier the same day — no
code was migrated before this reversal, so no rollback was needed.

---

## ADR-010 — Extracted the compliance layer into a standalone, framework-agnostic package
**Date:** 2026-07-05

**Context:** Following ADR-009's decision to keep Vent's direct pipeline instead of adopting an
orchestration framework, the identified leverage — automatic compliance that no competitor (hosted
platform or open-source framework) ships out of the box — needed to become concrete rather than aspirational.
Vent's compliance modules (`calling-window`, `dnc`, `consent`, `hipaa`, `gdpr`) were originally written
directly against Vent's own Drizzle/Turso schema, which meant they could only ever be "a compliance layer
inside one app," not something another developer — on any telephony stack or orchestration framework —
could adopt independently.

**Decision:** Extract all five compliance modules into a new workspace package, `packages/openvent-compliance`
(published as `@openvent/compliance`), with zero dependency on Twilio, Bun/Hono, or any specific database.
Storage-backed modules (`dnc`, `gdpr`) now accept a small adapter interface (`DncStorageAdapter`,
`CallLogStorageAdapter`) instead of importing Vent's `db` directly; in-memory reference adapters ship in
the package for quick starts and tests. Vent's own app was then refactored to consume the extracted
package via a thin Drizzle adapter (`packages/web/src/api/voice/compliance/adapters.ts`) — proving the
extraction works standalone by dogfooding it in the real, working app rather than leaving it untested.

**Consequences:** The package was verified with 13 unit tests covering every module using only the
in-memory adapters (no Vent-specific code touched), and the app's existing compliance behavior (DNC block,
calling-window enforcement, GDPR erasure, health-check reporting) was regression-tested via the same curl
checks used in prior sessions — all passed identically after the swap. This is the first concrete step of
the "library → framework" roadmap: the compliance layer is now something a Pipecat, LiveKit, or entirely
custom voice pipeline could adopt without adopting Vent itself. Packaging for public npm distribution
(making this installable outside this monorepo) remains a separate, not-yet-executed step.

## ADR-011 — v1.3 hardening pass: auth, signature validation, retry-cap fix, rate limiting
**Date:** 2026-07-05

**Context:** Before treating v1 as "done," a hardening pass was needed to close the gap between "works in
a sandbox with a trusted operator" and "safe to expose publicly." Several issues existed: ops endpoints had
no auth at all; Twilio webhooks accepted any request regardless of origin (forgeable); workflow retries had
a `maxRetries` field that was never actually checked, so a bad workflow config could redial a number
forever; the scheduler could double-execute a scheduled call under concurrent ticks; outbound calls had no
rate ceiling; and `sendSms` was a stub that logged instead of sending.

**Decision:** Close all of the above in one pass, each as the smallest correct fix rather than a bigger
redesign:
- Admin-key middleware (`X-Vent-Admin-Key` vs `ADMIN_API_KEY`) in front of every ops endpoint, warn-not-crash
  if unset (keeps local dev frictionless, makes the risk visible).
- Twilio's official request-signing scheme (`twilio.validateRequest`) in front of every inbound webhook.
- Atomic `pending`→`claimed` claim (conditional `UPDATE ... RETURNING`) in the scheduler, with a reset back
  to `pending` for calling-window-deferred rows (fixing a second, related bug where those rows got
  permanently stuck as `claimed`).
- `previousAttempt`/`nextAttempt` tracking so `maxRetries` is actually enforced.
- A basic fixed-window rate limiter on `/calls/outbound`, explicitly additive to (not a replacement for)
  the existing DNC/calling-window compliance gates.
- Wired `sendSms` to `twilioClient.messages.create()` for real.
- A National DNC registry *adapter shape* (`syncNationalDncRegistry`, `NationalRegistryFetcher`), shipped
  as a documented stub (`noopNationalRegistryFetcher`) rather than a real integration — the real US
  National DNC Registry requires a SAN (Subscription Account Number) that can't be provisioned in this
  sandbox. This closes the "we said we'd design for this later" gap from ADR-007 without pretending it's
  live.
- A tunnel supervisor script (`scripts/tunnel-supervisor.sh`) that watches `cloudflared`, restarts it on
  crash, and keeps `PUBLIC_APP_URL` + the Twilio webhook in sync with the tunnel's (rotating) URL. This is
  explicitly a mitigation for the quick-tunnel stopgap from ADR-008, not a fix for the underlying problem —
  the real fix remains a named tunnel or a persistent real domain.

**Consequences:** 12 new web-app tests and 2 new compliance-package tests added (40 total across both
packages, all passing); typecheck and build both clean. Regression-verified via curl: DNC add/list/remove,
E.164 rejection on `/dnc` and `/calls/outbound`, DNC-blocked outbound call returns `403`, malformed JSON
returns `400` not `500`, unsigned Twilio webhook rejected `403`, admin-key gate returns `401`
without/with-wrong key and `200` with the correct key. npm publishing of `@openvent/compliance` (ADR-010's
"remains a separate step") is still deferred — this round is about hardening the existing surface, not
distribution.

## ADR-012 — Structured call state as ground truth, not the transcript
**Date:** 2026-07-05

**Context:** A recurring production failure mode in voice agents (surfaced via a Reddit thread analyzed
alongside this project's own market research) is that agents re-ask for information the caller already
gave, or contradict earlier answers, once that information scrolls outside whatever the model effectively
attends to. This isn't a model-quality problem — it happens even with strong models — because the only
"memory" most voice-agent stacks have is the raw transcript (or a lossy summary/RAG layer over it), with no
deterministic, structured source of truth the agent is required to read from. Vent had this same gap:
`history: ModelMessage[]` was the only state a call carried.

**Decision:** Add a structured `CallState` layer that sits alongside, not instead of, the transcript:
- A new `captureField` tool (`voice/tools/captureField.ts`) lets the agent explicitly record a durable fact
  (email, order ID, name, callback time, etc.) as a `{ field, value }` pair the moment the caller states it,
  rather than leaving extraction implicit in free text.
- `calls.capturedState` (new JSON column) and `CallSession.capturedState` (session-store) hold this as a
  plain `Record<string, string>` — deterministic, inspectable, and persisted continuously (on every
  `captureField` call, not just at call end) so it survives a mid-call crash and shows up on the dashboard
  immediately.
- `agent.ts`'s `buildKnownFactsBlock()` renders the current state as an explicit "Known facts — already
  confirmed, do not ask for these again" block appended to the system prompt every turn. The model is told
  what's known instead of being expected to re-derive it from scrollback.
- This was deliberately scoped as a feature *within* Vent's existing compliance/self-hosted positioning,
  not a repositioning of the project. Compliance, audit logging, and debugging all benefit from the same
  structured state (a captured `disposition` or DNC-triggering fact is exactly this kind of data already);
  this generalizes that pattern instead of introducing a separate identity for it.

**Consequences:** Two new test files (`agent.test.ts`, `tools/captureField.test.ts`, 6 tests) exercise
`buildKnownFactsBlock`'s empty/populated/multi-field/non-mutating behavior and the tool's shape; full suite
(48 tests across both packages) still green, typecheck and build clean, `db:push` applied the new column
with no manual migration needed (SQLite JSON text column). A companion dashboard (`/dashboard`) was built in
the same round specifically to make captured state visible and auditable per call, not just log lines — see
the dashboard section of README.md. Not done in this round: no automatic slot *schema* per persona (i.e. no
way to declare "this persona must capture email + order_id before ending the call") — the model decides
what's worth capturing based on the tool description alone. That's a reasonable next step if this needs to
become stricter (e.g. compliance-required fields) rather than best-effort.

---

## ADR-013 — Named Cloudflare tunnel replaces the quick-tunnel supervisor
**Date:** 2026-07-05

**Context:** ADR-008 documented the free `trycloudflare.com` quick-tunnel's core problem: it assigns a new
random URL on every restart, so `PUBLIC_APP_URL` and the Twilio Voice webhook drift out of sync whenever
the tunnel drops. ADR-011's `tunnel-supervisor.sh` mitigated the pain (auto-restart + auto-update the
webhook on URL change) but explicitly said the real fix was a named tunnel or a persistent real domain.
The user now has a Cloudflare account and a domain (DNS managed on Vercel, not moved to Cloudflare).

**Decision:** Create a real named Cloudflare Tunnel via the Cloudflare API rather than the quick-tunnel:
- `POST /accounts/:id/cfd_tunnel` creates a persistent tunnel with a fixed ID; ingress config routes
  `vent.<domain>` → `http://localhost:4200` via `PUT /accounts/:id/cfd_tunnel/:id/configurations`.
- DNS stays on Vercel — a tunnel only needs a CNAME pointing at `<tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com`; moving the
  zone to Cloudflare was never required. This CNAME is added manually in Vercel's panel (not automatable
  without Vercel API credentials, which weren't requested).
- The tunnel token is stored in `.cloudflare-tunnel-token` (repo-root, gitignored, never committed) rather
  than passed inline on the command line, to avoid it ending up in shell history or a tmux pane buffer.
- Run via `scripts/run-cloudflare-tunnel.sh`, managed by PM2 (`cloudflare-tunnel` process) alongside
  `web-app` — consistent with how the main server is already supervised, and gives automatic restart on
  crash without a separate bash-loop supervisor.
- `tunnel-supervisor.sh` (ADR-011) is kept in the repo but marked superseded — still useful as a fallback
  for local dev without a domain, but no longer what's actually running.
- `PUBLIC_APP_URL` and the Twilio number's Voice webhook were both updated to the new fixed hostname; no
  more rotation, so no auto-update logic is needed for this path (unlike the quick-tunnel's URL-on-every-
  restart problem).

**Consequences:** This closes the last open item from ADR-011's hardening round. The tunnel has a fixed
hostname now, so call quality/webhook delivery no longer depends on catching a URL-rotation event in time.
Tradeoff: standing up this tunnel required real Cloudflare account credentials (API token, account ID) —
fine for this project since the user has them, but means the setup isn't zero-account like the quick-tunnel
was; documented in README as an optional-but-recommended step for anyone self-hosting Vent long-term.

---

## ADR-014 — Reverted ADR-013: back to the quick-tunnel, named tunnel parked
**Date:** 2026-07-05

**Context:** ADR-013's plan assumed a plain CNAME on Vercel's DNS could point at a Cloudflare Tunnel. It
can't: `<tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com` only resolves inside Cloudflare's own proxy network, so the hostname
has to actually be *proxied by Cloudflare* (orange-cloud on), not just pointed at from an external DNS
provider. The fix would have been Cloudflare's Partial (CNAME) Setup — letting Cloudflare proxy one
subdomain while everything else stays on Vercel — but Cloudflare has since restricted that to
Enterprise/partner accounts; free-tier setup now requires migrating the zone's nameservers to Cloudflare
entirely (Vercel hosting would still work fine as DNS-only records after the move, but it's real migration
effort and propagation time).

**Decision:** Not worth it right now. The project is heading into a Reddit/community-feedback and
build-in-public phase, not a public launch depending on a stable domain — the free quick-tunnel's rotating
URLs are a non-issue at this stage since `tunnel-supervisor.sh` (ADR-008/ADR-011) already auto-updates
`PUBLIC_APP_URL` and the Twilio webhook on every rotation. Reverted: killed the `cloudflare-tunnel` PM2
process, restarted the quick-tunnel under the existing supervisor script, confirmed `/api/health` responds
`200` on the new quick-tunnel URL after a `pm2 restart web-app --update-env`.

**Consequences:** `scripts/run-cloudflare-tunnel.sh` and the Cloudflare tunnel/DNS config created in
ADR-013 are left in place (tunnel still exists, ingress still configured) in case nameserver migration
happens later — nothing to redo except re-adding the CNAME once DNS actually sits on Cloudflare. No code
changes this round, only infra/ops. Revisit named-tunnel setup once there's a real reason for a stable
public domain (real user traffic, a production launch) rather than doing it preemptively.

## ADR-015 — Open-core framework, not a pure library or a pure hosted platform
**Date:** 2026-07-05

**Context:** Early community feedback (Reddit, pre-launch research round) raised a concrete gap:
"lack of good integrations... their ability to listen to me and understand what I want to do" — i.e. Vent
doesn't fit into the tools people already run, and the one CRM integration that exists (`crmSync`,
HubSpot-only) is a hardcoded stub. Answering that well required deciding what Vent actually *is* as a
product, not just what to build next — because "add more integrations" implies very different things
depending on whether this is a library, a framework, or a platform.

Three shapes were considered:
- **Pure library** (just `@openvent/compliance` and friends on npm): low switching cost for adopters, but our
  own market research showed this doesn't monetize directly — GitHub Sponsors plus a hosted convenience
  layer is the standard pattern for OSS infra, not download counts alone. Also weak as something to pitch —
  "we maintain an npm package" isn't a fundable story.
- **Pure hosted platform** (compete directly with Vapi/Retell/LiveKit Cloud): would abandon Vent's actual
  edge. The single most-repeated complaint surfaced in the market research was "the biggest issue isn't the
  tech, it's the lock-in" — going head-to-head with well-funded managed platforms puts Vent in the one lane
  where it has no advantage.
- **Open-core framework** (chosen): the self-hosted pipeline (Twilio/Deepgram/LLM/TTS, the state engine,
  the compliance module, the dashboard) stays free and fully open — this is the trust mechanism for the
  self-hosted/OSS audience the research validated, and every claim about "your keys, your data" stays
  independently verifiable by reading the code. A paid layer ("Vent Cloud") sits on top: managed hosting so
  people don't have to hand-roll tunnels/PM2/Twilio wiring, a hosted multi-tenant dashboard, premium
  pre-built integrations (see the GoHighLevel/Salesforce/Google Calendar work started this round), and —
  directly solving today's stub — a paid, hosted national DNC registry sync (Vent holds the FTC SAN
  subscription once, amortized across many customers, instead of each self-hoster needing their own).

**Decision:** Vent is an open-core framework. Free/open forever: the core pipeline, state engine,
compliance primitives (DNC list, calling-window enforcement, GDPR erasure), and dashboard. Paid, later:
managed hosting, premium integrations, hosted national DNC sync, enterprise/HIPAA support. This is the
model used by comparable OSS infra companies (Supabase, n8n, PostHog) and is a recognizable, fundable shape
if this is ever pitched: "self-hosted and free to verify, or pay us to host it and handle the regulatory
parts you don't want to own yourself."

**Consequences:** Near-term work (integration resilience wrapper, GoHighLevel/Salesforce/Google Calendar
integrations) is unchanged in scope but is now understood as the seed of the future paid tier, not just
"more open-source features" — worth keeping in mind when deciding what ships free vs. gated later. Bigger
follow-on work this implies but does not require yet: multi-tenancy, billing, a hosted deploy path — none
of that is being built now, only decided as the direction. No code changes this round.

## ADR-016 — "Self-hosted" reframed as a three-tier spectrum, not a binary claim
**Date:** 2026-07-05

**Context:** Early Reddit feedback (r/AI_Agents, r/VoiceAutomationAI — see `reddit-feedback.md`, not
committed) pushed back, correctly, on calling Vent "self-hosted" without qualification: "self-hosted is a
bit of a stretch if you're still routing through Twilio and Deepgram, the data still goes through their
servers," and a sub-reply: "true self-hosted voice AI is nearly impossible end to end because PSTN is
always a third party." Both are right. Vent has never run its own telephony network or its own LLM
inference, and saying "self-hosted" without qualification invited the reasonable assumption that it might.

Talking this through surfaced a clearer model: voice-agent architectures sit on a spectrum, not a binary.
One end is fully local (Ollama/local-LLM + local STT/TTS, zero cloud dependency, real but requires owning
GPU hardware and accepting a quality/latency tradeoff against frontier cloud models — this is what
r/LocalLLaMA is actually about). The other end is fully managed (Vapi, Retell, LiveKit Cloud — zero infra
to run, but zero control, no data ownership, no provider choice). Vent sits in the middle: the
*orchestration layer* is self-hosted (code, database, call logic, compliance rules, dashboard — all
inspectable and owned by the operator) while the *AI layer* (LLM inference, STT, TTS) and the *telephony
layer* (PSTN via Twilio) remain cloud APIs by necessity — no one can self-host a phone network, and
running frontier-quality LLM inference locally is a different, harder product with its own real tradeoffs.

**Decision:** Stop using "self-hosted" as an unqualified, standalone claim. Adopt "self-hosted
orchestration, bring-your-own AI providers" as the precise, headline description everywhere it matters
(README, docs, landing page, the agent's own description of itself). Do not chase the fully-local end of
the spectrum as a roadmap item — that's a different product with different tradeoffs (GPU cost, latency,
model-quality ceiling), and it's not what the compliance/state-engine/no-lock-in bets already made are
built around. Own the middle of the spectrum deliberately, and be explicit about exactly which layer is
owned vs. which layer is still a cloud API — precision reads as more trustworthy to this exact developer
audience than a vaguer, more sweeping claim, especially once someone opens the code and finds Twilio and an
AI Gateway client in there.

**Consequences:** Copy updated in this round: README hero/feature copy, `docs/architecture.md`, the
landing page hero/problem sections, and the voice agent's own persona description (`agent.ts`'s
`DEFAULT_PERSONA`, which explains what Vent is if a caller asks) — all now describe the three-tier
spectrum and Vent's specific position on it, rather than a bare "self-hosted" claim. This is a
documentation/positioning change only, no functional code changes. Drafted (not yet posted) Reddit replies
acknowledging the original feedback directly and pointing to this clarification are in
`reddit-feedback.md`.

## ADR-017 — Compliance audit-trail export
**Date:** 2026-07-06

**Context:** Direct, repeated community feedback (see `reddit-feedback.md`, not committed, and
`docs/strategy-2026-07.md`) identified a concrete gap: Vent enforces compliance (DNC, calling-window,
recording/AI disclosure) but never packaged what it enforces into something an operator could hand to a
lawyer or compliance officer on demand. Direct quote from feedback: "the thing that actually kills the
compliance fear isn't more warnings, it's being able to show who called whom, with what consent, and what
the agent said." All of that data already existed (`calls`, `transcripts`, `doNotCall` tables) — it just
required manual reconstruction across multiple tables, which is exactly the wrong thing to be doing under
the pressure of an actual regulatory inquiry.

**Decision:** Add an audit-trail module to `@openvent/compliance` (`audit-trail.ts`), following the package's
existing storage-adapter pattern (`CallAuditStorageAdapter`, sibling to `DncStorageAdapter`/
`CallLogStorageAdapter`) so it stays framework-agnostic and adoptable outside Vent's own app. It assembles,
per call: direction, numbers, timing, status, disposition, current DNC status (checked at export time, not
call time, since a number can be DNC'd after a call happened), full transcript, and — the one piece that
required real judgment — whether the recording/AI disclosure was *actually spoken*, not just configured
on. That check does a conservative substring match against the first agent transcript turn; a false
"not confirmed" is the safe failure direction (prompts a human to double-check), a false "confirmed" would
not be.

Two entry points: `buildCallAuditRecord` (one call) and `buildPhoneNumberAuditTrail` (every call involving
a number — the more common real request). `renderAuditTrailText` formats either as plain text suitable for
handing to a lawyer as-is; JSON is available by serializing the records directly for programmatic/tooling
use. Wired into the app via a Drizzle adapter (`voice/compliance/adapters.ts`'s `callAuditAdapter`,
following the exact pattern of the existing `dncAdapter`/`callLogAdapter`) and two new admin-key-gated
routes: `GET /calls/:id/audit` and `GET /callers/:phoneNumber/audit`, both supporting `?format=text`.
Surfaced in the dashboard two ways: an "Export compliance audit" button on the call-detail page, and a new
dedicated `/dashboard/audit` page for the per-number lookup case.

**Consequences:** 10 new tests in `openvent-compliance` (25 total in that package, 74 across both packages),
typecheck/build/lint all clean, and the two new endpoints were regression-tested live against real call
data (401 without admin key, 404 for an unknown call id, 200 with an empty array for a number with no
calls, correct oldest-first ordering for multi-call lookups, correct disclosure-confirmed/not-confirmed
detection against real transcripts). This is the first concrete build item to come directly out of the
community feedback rounds (see `docs/strategy-2026-07.md`) — previously "in progress" items (integrations,
resilience layer) were already done; this was reprioritized ahead of the other candidates (per-call latency
breakdown, cross-call memory) because it was cheapest, most differentiated, and most directly requested.
Not done in this round: no PDF export (plain text was judged sufficient for "hand this to a lawyer" and
avoids a new dependency); no bulk/all-numbers export (per-number and per-call cover the realistic request
shapes identified in feedback).

## ADR-018 — Switch from MIT to a fair-code license (Vent Sustainable Use License)
**Date:** 2026-07-07

**Context:** ADR-015 already committed Vent to an open-core model — self-hosted core free forever, a paid
"Vent Cloud" layer later — explicitly citing n8n, Supabase, and PostHog as the comparable shape. Those
projects don't ship under plain MIT, though: n8n uses the Sustainable Use License, Supabase mixes Apache
2.0 with some fair-code-style components on premium pieces. Plain MIT (Vent's license until now) grants
anyone the right to fork, host, and resell the software as a competing managed service, royalty-free, with
no obligation back — which directly undercuts the future "Vent Cloud" paid layer ADR-015 already decided
to build. At zero external users and zero forks today, this is the cheapest point to fix it; once outside
contributors or forks exist, relicensing needs their consent and gets materially harder.

**Decision:** Replace the MIT `LICENSE` with the **Vent Sustainable Use License** (adapted from n8n's
Sustainable Use License v1.0): free to self-host, modify, and use for internal business or personal
purposes, forever, with source fully readable and verifiable — but not licensed for repackaging as a
competing hosted/managed commercial service without a separate commercial license from the licensor. No
`.ee`-style file-level split was introduced in this round (that's a bigger structural change to defer until
there's an actual premium-integration surface worth gating); the whole repo moved to the new license as one
change. `README.md`'s license section and `packages/openvent-compliance/package.json`'s license field were
updated to match.

**Consequences:** Anyone already relying on Vent under the old MIT terms before this commit keeps those
rights for the code as it existed then (MIT grants don't retroactively revoke), but all code from this
commit forward is fair-code licensed. No functional code changes. This is a licensing/positioning change
only, made now specifically because the project has no external contributors or forks yet to complicate
it.

## ADR-019 — Full rebrand from "Vent" to "OpenVent"
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** The exact domain `vent.com`/`.dev`/`.org`/`.app`/`.ai`/`.io`/`.co` was unavailable across every
budget-reasonable TLD. `openvent.dev` was available at a flat, honest renewal price (no bait-and-switch
TLD pricing), and — unlike a suffixed domain trick (e.g. `getvent.dev`) — "OpenVent" also does real
positioning work: it puts the project's actual thesis (open-core, self-hosted, read-the-code-before-you-
trust-it) directly in the name, not just the URL. The alternative considered was keeping the product name
"Vent" and only using a prefixed domain — cheaper to execute, but it leaves the domain and the brand saying
two different things forever.

**Decision:** Full rename, not just a domain-layer relabel: product name, landing page copy, docs, README,
LICENSE (now the "OpenVent Sustainable Use License"), the standalone compliance package (`@vent/compliance`
→ `@openvent/compliance`, folder `packages/vent-compliance` → `packages/openvent-compliance`), and the
admin-auth header (`X-Vent-Admin-Key` → `X-OpenVent-Admin-Key`, updated in both the frontend client and the
backend middleware that reads it). Alongside the rename, added a full SEO/AEO layer that didn't exist
before: `index.html`'s title was a literal placeholder (`"Web"`) with no meta description, no Open Graph
tags, and the `og-image.png` was an unrelated leftover template asset — all replaced with real OpenVent-
specific meta tags, a new branded OG image, `SoftwareApplication` + `FAQPage` JSON-LD, `robots.txt`,
`sitemap.xml`, and `llms.txt` (a plain-text summary aimed at AI answer engines/crawlers). A visible FAQ
section was added to the landing page itself so the `FAQPage` schema reflects real on-page content rather
than being schema-only (search engines can penalize or ignore structured data that doesn't match visible
page content).

**Consequences:** Historical entries above this one in this file are left as originally written — they
correctly record what the project was called and how the package was named at the time each decision was
made. Only this entry and everything going forward uses "OpenVent." The GitHub repository itself was not
renamed (still `github.com/I-invincib1e/vent`) — GitHub repo renames risk breaking the existing Vercel Git
integration, and the badge/link in `README.md` already points at the correct fork; only the product's own
name, package name, and public-facing copy changed. No functional code changes beyond the header rename
(compliance/auth logic itself is untouched).

## ADR-020 — Landing page storytelling rebuild: real logos, scroll-driven diagram, drop stale demo data
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** The landing page's Product Tour section showed screenshots that had gone stale — old
"Vent" branding, a placeholder phone number, a fake test transcript — while still claiming "not a
mockup, real calls." Separately, the pipeline diagram used generic lucide icons with text labels
("Twilio", "Deepgram", "ElevenLabs") instead of the providers' actual marks, and every section used
the same simple viewport-enter fade regardless of what it was trying to communicate.

**Decision:** Three changes, done together:
1. Removed the Product Tour section and its three stale screenshots entirely (`packages/web/public/
   demo/`) rather than patch them — real screenshots come later, once there's a current instance to
   capture, not before.
2. Replaced the linear icon-based pipeline with a real boxes-and-hub architecture diagram
   (`architecture.tsx`) using the providers' actual official marks (Twilio, Deepgram, ElevenLabs,
   Cartesia, Groq, n8n, Zapier, GitHub — sourced from simple-icons, Wikimedia Commons, and Cartesia's
   own site directly, never AI-generated, normalized to single-color `currentColor` React components
   in `logos.tsx` so they recolor with the rest of the UI instead of clashing brand colors), plus a
   real interactive piece: clicking the TTS node swaps its label/logo between ElevenLabs and Cartesia,
   demonstrating the actual env-var provider swap instead of just describing it in prose.
3. Gave each remaining section a scroll treatment that matches what it's saying, not a uniform fade:
   the provider strip is now an infinite logo marquee (pauses on hover), the Problem comparison table
   reveals row-by-row tied to scroll position, Features/Shipped use a scroll-stack effect (cards
   settle into place as the next arrives), Roadmap's "shipped" checkmarks scale in as you scroll past
   them, and the FAQ became a real accordion (first item open by default) instead of everything always
   expanded — while keeping every answer's text present in the DOM so the `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema
   still matches real page content. Added GSAP + `@gsap/react` for the one component (`split-text.tsx`,
   a character-by-character reveal on the hero's "OpenVent") where GSAP is a meaningfully better fit
   than Motion for staggering dozens of individual tweens; everything else stays on Motion
   (framer-motion), already the project's animation library.

**Consequences:** No backend/data changes — this is a landing-page-only round. `bunx tsc --noEmit`
and `bunx vite build` both clean, all 25 `@openvent/compliance` tests still passing (untouched by this
round). One real bug caught during this work worth noting for future editing sessions: several
sub-component definitions (`ProblemRow`, `DoneItem`) were dropped by an editing pass that replaced
their call sites without the definitions actually landing in the file, causing runtime
`ReferenceError`s that only surfaced in the browser console, not in `tsc`or the build step — worth
double-checking rendered output in-browser after structural refactors, not just relying on
typecheck/build passing.

---

## ADR-021 — Telephony provider abstraction: deferred, scoped, documented (no code this round)
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** Starting a round of work on four roadmap items (per-call latency breakdown, cross-call
memory, multi-user dashboard auth, Redis session storage), the question of "shouldn't OpenVent not be
Twilio-specific" came up. Worth deciding deliberately rather than either ignoring it or scope-creeping
this round into a telephony rewrite. Concrete coupling points found during exploration, so this is a
scoped decision, not a vague aspiration:

- `packages/web/src/api/database/schema.ts` — `calls.twilioCallSid` bakes Twilio's naming into the
  schema itself, not just an implementation detail.
- `packages/web/src/api/voice/routes.ts` — `/incoming`, `/status-callback`, `/recording-status` are
  shaped exactly like Twilio's webhook contract; outbound calling goes through `twilioClient.calls.create()`
  directly, no intermediate interface.
- `packages/web/src/api/voice/middleware/twilio-signature.ts` — signature validation is Twilio-specific
  by construction (Twilio's own HMAC scheme).
- `packages/web/src/api/voice/stream.ts` — the per-call WebSocket state machine assumes Twilio Media
  Stream's exact event shape (base64 mu-law frames, `start`/`media`/`stop` events) with no abstraction
  layer between "a phone call is happening" and "Twilio specifically is happening."

**Decision:** Not touched this round. The four roadmap items below don't require it, and doing it
properly (a `TelephonyProvider` interface, renaming `twilioCallSid` → a generic `providerCallId`,
abstracting the Media Stream event shape) is its own significant, separate piece of work that deserves
its own dedicated round rather than being bolted on as a side effect of unrelated work. Recording this
now so the eventual work has a concrete starting list instead of starting from scratch.

**Consequences:** No code changes. `ROADMAP.md`'s "Later" section updated to reference this ADR instead
of a bare one-line mention, so the next person (or the next round) picking this up has the actual
coupling points to work from.

---

## ADR-022 — Per-call latency breakdown: first-value-only, persisted once at call end
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** LLM time-to-first-token was already computed (`agent.ts`'s `onLatency` callback) but only
`console.log`'d in `stream.ts`, never surfaced. STT connect time and TTS first-audio-byte time weren't
tracked at all. Flagged repeatedly as the top remaining ask from the community feedback rounds
(`docs/strategy-2026-07.md`).

**Decision:** New table `callLatency` (one row per call, additive migration, `callId` as primary key),
three nullable columns: `sttConnectMs`, `llmTtftMs`, `ttsFirstByteMs`. Each is captured **once per call,
first value wins** — not per-turn, not continuously updated. STT connect is captured in `deepgram.ts` on
the first successful `open` event (guarded so reconnects don't overwrite it — that's already covered by
the separate `sttReconnectCount`/`totalGapMs` stats). LLM TTFT is captured from whichever turn produces
a value first — usually the greeting, since `runVoiceAgentGreeting` didn't previously forward
`onLatency` at all and now does. TTS first-byte is captured by wrapping the existing `onAudioChunk`
forwarding callback in `stream.ts`'s `speak()` with a `Date.now()` delta on the first chunk of the
first turn, rather than modifying `elevenlabs.ts`/`cartesia.ts` — keeps the TTS provider files untouched
and provider-agnostic, matching the existing abstraction (see ADR referenced in `docs/architecture.md`).
Unlike `capturedState`, latency isn't persisted continuously mid-call (no crash-recovery need for it) —
one row is written in `finalizeCall()`, and only if at least one metric was actually captured (a call
that failed before Deepgram ever connected doesn't get a pointless all-null row).

**Consequences:** New `GET /calls/:id/latency` endpoint, new "Latency breakdown" panel on the call-detail
dashboard page — renders "not recorded" per-field rather than `0ms` or crashing for calls with no data
(historical calls before this shipped, or calls that failed early). No changes to the TTS/STT provider
files' own interfaces — the timing wrap lives entirely in `stream.ts`, the one place that already
orchestrates all three stages. Not unit-tested in the traditional sense (the capture points are wired
into `stream.ts`'s WebSocket state machine and the real STT/TTS network connections, which the existing
test suite doesn't mock — consistent with how `stream.ts` itself has no direct unit tests today);
verified via `tsc`/`vite build`/existing 49-test suite passing unchanged, plus a manual dashboard render
check for both the populated and null-field cases.

---

---

## ADR-023 — Cross-call memory: flat key/value overlay, merged not replaced
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** `capturedState` (ADR-012) is scoped to a single call — a returning caller starts from zero
every time, which the ROADMAP had already flagged ("OpenVent doesn't have this at all today"). Needed a
mechanism that survives across calls without turning into a second, competing source of truth against
`capturedState`, and without an unbounded per-caller history that would grow the prompt injection cost
forever.

**Decision:** New table `callerMemory`, one row per phone number, a flat JSON key/value `facts` column —
deliberately the same shape as `capturedState`, not a free-text summary and not a call-by-call log. On
each call's `finalizeCall`, `upsertCallerMemory` merges that call's `capturedState` into the existing
row (`{ ...existing, ...newFacts }` — later calls overwrite matching keys, new keys accumulate), a no-op
if nothing was captured. No LLM summarization call involved — this stays free to compute. Which number
is "the human" depends on call direction (`resolveHumanNumber`): `fromNumber` on an inbound call, but
`toNumber` on an outbound call, since `fromNumber` there is the operator's own Twilio number, not a real
person — worth a dedicated pure function since getting this backwards would silently key memory off the
operator's own number. Injected into the system prompt via `buildCallerMemoryBlock`, clearly labeled
"from a previous call... may be outdated" — distinct wording from `buildKnownFactsBlock`'s this-call
facts, which the model treats as settled ground truth. `runVoiceAgentGreeting` previously didn't forward
`onLatency` *or* accept `callerMemory` at all — both gaps fixed together since they're the same call site.

**Consequences:** New `caller-memory.ts` module, `resolveHumanNumber` unit-tested directly (pure
function); `getCallerMemory`/`upsertCallerMemory` aren't unit-tested against a real DB (consistent with
how the rest of this file's DB-touching code is verified — integration-level via the live pipeline, not
mocked). No changes to `capturedState`'s own behavior or table. Additive migration only.

---

## ADR-024 — Fixed a repo-wide silent typecheck gap: `tsc --noEmit` was checking nothing
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** While building Phase 1/2, `bunx tsc --noEmit` (invoked exactly as `packages/web`'s
`typecheck` and `build` scripts run it, and exactly as `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs it in CI)
reported zero errors on a file that was — confirmed by direct inspection — missing an import and
referencing an undefined name. Root cause: `packages/web/tsconfig.json` is a solution-style config
(`"files": []`, only `"references"` to `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`). Running plain
`tsc --noEmit` against a references-only config with no `--build` flag does nothing — it doesn't error,
it silently type-checks an empty file set and exits 0. This has been true since the project template was
scaffolded, meaning **CI's typecheck step, and every "tsc clean" verification claimed in this project's
history (including this session's own ADR-020 and ADR-022), was not actually checking anything.**
Running `tsc -b` (or `-p tsconfig.app.json` / `-p tsconfig.node.json` explicitly) surfaced real,
pre-existing errors: several dashboard pages (`calls-list.tsx`, `dnc.tsx`, `call-detail.tsx`) accessed
properties directly on a Hono client's `{error} | {data}` union return type without narrowing first
(worked at runtime because the error branch never actually fires in normal use, but was never provably
type-safe), `admin-key-gate.tsx`'s typed RPC call resolved to `never` (root cause not fully isolated;
worked around by using a plain `fetch` there instead, since that call site only needs the HTTP status,
not a typed payload), `dnc.tsx` used a nonexistent `entry.id` (the DNC entry type has no `id` field —
fixed to key on `entry.phoneNumber`, which is actually unique), an unused `motion` import in `stack.tsx`,
and a `MotionValue<unknown>` vs `MotionValue<number>` mismatch in `architecture.tsx` from an untyped
`ReturnType<typeof useTransform>`. Also surfaced, and separately worth noting: this session's own edits
to `stream.ts`, `deepgram.ts`, `agent.ts`, `routes.ts`, and `call-detail.tsx` had several instances of an
edit silently not landing (a call site referencing a name that was never actually declared) — invisible
until real typechecking existed to catch it.

**Decision:** Changed `packages/web/package.json`'s `typecheck` script from `tsc --noEmit` to `tsc -b`,
and `build` from `tsc --noEmit && vite build` to `tsc -b && vite build` — both now honor the project
references and actually check `src/web` and `src/server.ts`/`vite.config.ts`. Fixed every error this
surfaced (listed above) rather than just the ones blocking this round's own work. Fixed
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s stale `packages/vent-compliance` references (two steps) left over from the
OpenVent rebrand (ADR-019/ADR-020) — the directory has been `packages/openvent-compliance` since then,
meaning CI's compliance-package steps have also been silently misconfigured since that rebrand.

**Consequences:** `bun run typecheck` and `bun run build` are now meaningfully trustworthy for the first
time — any future "verified: tsc clean" claim in this file means something. No functional/runtime
behavior changes beyond the `admin-key-gate.tsx` fetch-instead-of-RPC-client swap and the `dnc.tsx` key
fix, both of which are strictly more correct than before. Worth remembering going forward: after any
multi-file edit, verify with `tsc -b` (not bare `tsc --noEmit` on this project's root config), and
re-grep-verify individual edits landed rather than trusting an edit tool's success response alone —
demonstrated real value this round.

---

## ADR-025 — Multi-user dashboard auth: labeled API keys, not accounts
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** `ADMIN_API_KEY` (a single shared env-var secret) is fine for a solo operator but has no way
to tell which team member or integration used a key, and no way to revoke one person's access without
rotating the secret for everyone. Explicitly scoped down by the user to labeled API keys, not real
username/password accounts — this is the framework's own operator auth, not a customer-facing product
login system.

**Decision:** New table `adminKeys` (additive): `label`, `keyHash` (SHA-256, not a slow password hash —
these are high-entropy generated tokens with no offline-guessing risk, and a fast hash keeps every
admin-gated request cheap), `createdAt`, `lastUsedAt`, `revokedAt` (soft-delete, keeps an audit trail
instead of a hard row delete). `middleware/admin-auth.ts` checks two paths in order: (1) the legacy
`ADMIN_API_KEY` env var — **this path never goes away**, every existing deployment already has it set;
(2) a labeled key hash lookup. The original "nothing configured → warn and allow" local-dev fallback is
preserved, but now conditioned on *no labeled key ever having been created either* — once an operator
deliberately starts using labeled keys, an unset env var shouldn't silently reopen the gate. New
endpoints `POST/GET /admin-keys` and `DELETE /admin-keys/:id`, all gated by `requireAdminKey` itself
(you need a valid key to create more). New dashboard page `/dashboard/settings` — generate a key, see it
in plaintext exactly once with a copy button, list existing keys with created/last-used timestamps,
revoke.

**Consequences:** No breaking change for any existing deployment — `ADMIN_API_KEY` alone continues to
work exactly as before if an operator never touches the new feature. `hashAdminKey` unit-tested directly
(deterministic, collision-resistant across different inputs, fixed-length output, never leaks the
plaintext); the DB-touching CRUD functions aren't unit-tested against a real database, consistent with
this project's existing pattern for DB-touching code elsewhere. Verified with the (now-actually-working,
see ADR-024) `tsc -b`, `vite build`, and the full test suite.

---

## ADR-026 — Redis-backed session storage: optional, opt-in, async interface either way
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** `session-store.ts`'s own file header already documented the gap: "process-local state, fine
for single-instance, swap for Redis/DB-backed storage if you scale to multiple instances." The user left
the resourcing call to the agent, with one hard constraint: don't force a new required external
dependency on solo/small-team self-hosters who never need to scale past one instance.

**Decision:** `SessionStore` became an explicit interface (`get`/`set`/`update`/`delete`/`size`, all
async now — Redis I/O can't be synchronous, so the in-memory implementation moved to async too, even
though it doesn't need to be, purely so switching backends is a config change and never a call-site code
change). Two implementations: `MemorySessionStore` (today's exact `Map`-based logic, now behind the
interface, still the default) and `RedisSessionStore` (`ioredis`, one JSON-serialized key per call,
native `PX` TTL instead of the manual sweep interval, `update` reads the remaining TTL and preserves it
rather than resetting the full hour on every small patch like a `captureField` write mid-call). A factory
at module load picks the implementation based on whether `process.env.REDIS_URL` is set — unset, and
behavior is 100% identical to before this ADR, no new dependency actually exercised at runtime. Every
call site across `stream.ts`, `routes.ts`, and `workflows/scheduler.ts` (11 call sites total) needed an
`await` added — all were already inside `async` functions, so mechanically safe, but each one was
verified individually rather than assumed.

**Consequences:** New `ioredis` dependency (only imported/constructed when `REDIS_URL` is actually set).
Docs gained a "Scaling to multiple instances" section in `configuration.md` recommending Upstash's free
tier as the lowest-setup option for anyone who does need this, while being explicit that any
Redis-compatible service works — no vendor lock-in, it's a plain connection string. Verified two ways:
the existing `session-store.test.ts` suite (rewritten for the async interface, still exercises the
default in-memory path, all passing) and a real, temporary local Redis instance
(`apt install redis-server`, since none was otherwise available) — set/get/update-merge/update-preserves-
TTL/size/delete all confirmed working end to end against real Redis, not just inferred from reading the
code, then removed after verification.

## ADR-027 — Docs/landing-page sync after the four-item round
**Date:** 2026-07-08

**Context:** ADR-022, ADR-023, ADR-025, and ADR-026 each shipped code + tests, but the public-facing surface
(landing page roadmap/shipped sections, `README.md`, `docs/*.md`, `.env.example`) still described the
pre-round state — stale "known limitations" bullets claiming in-memory-only session state and a single
shared admin key, `docs/state-engine.md` silent on cross-call memory, `.env.example` missing both
`ADMIN_API_KEY` and `REDIS_URL` entirely. Landing copy said "rolling per-phone-number history," which
overstates what ADR-023 actually built (a merged flat key/value overlay, not a call-by-call log) — fixed to
match.

**Decision:** No code changes. Docs-only round:
- `packages/web/src/web/components/landing/roadmap.tsx` — moved all four items from `next[]` into `done[]`,
  replaced `next[]` with the three items actually still open (hosted DNC/SAN, telephony abstraction, npm
  publish), corrected the cross-call-memory wording.
- `packages/web/src/web/components/landing/shipped.tsx` — added two new cards (latency + cross-call
  memory; multi-user keys + Redis sessions) so the highlighted "Shipped Since Launch" section isn't missing
  the newest work.
- `docs/api-reference.md` — added the three new endpoints (`/calls/:id/latency`, `/calls/:id/audit`,
  `/admin-keys` CRUD) that existed in code but not in the reference table.
- `docs/dashboard.md` — documented the Latency panel, Audit page, and Keys page.
- `docs/state-engine.md` — new "Cross-call memory" section describing `callerMemory`, the merge behavior,
  and the inbound/outbound human-number resolution, cross-referenced to ADR-023.
- `.env.example` — added `ADMIN_API_KEY` (legacy bootstrap path) and `REDIS_URL` (optional, opt-in) with
  inline comments matching their actual runtime behavior.
- `README.md` — fixed the two stale "Known limitations" bullets, added feature bullets for the four shipped
  items, updated the Live link from the old preview URL to `openvent.dev`.
- `ROADMAP.md` — removed two now-stale "Later" bullets (multi-tenant dashboard auth, Redis/DB session
  storage) that the four-item round already shipped; replaced with a narrower "full multi-tenant
  accounts" item reflecting what's actually still open beyond labeled admin keys.

**Consequences:** Verified via `tsc -b --force` (clean), `bun run build` (clean), 55/55 web tests, 25/25
`@openvent/compliance` tests — no code paths touched, so this is a low-risk documentation commit riding on
top of already-verified ADR-022/023/025/026 code.

## ADR-028 — Relicense from the Vent Sustainable Use License back to Apache 2.0, protect the name via trademark instead

**Date:** 2026-07-09

**Context:** ADR-018 moved the project from MIT to a fair-code license (Vent/OpenVent Sustainable Use
License) specifically to prevent a cloud provider from hosting the software as a competing managed service
ahead of a future "OpenVent Cloud" paid layer. Since then, the actual near-term priority shifted: the goal
now is making OpenVent genuinely open for outside contribution — real PRs, real community trust, potential
inclusion in ecosystem listings and integrations. A source-available, non-OSI license works against that
goal in practice: it's unfamiliar to most contributors, triggers legal-review friction at companies that
might otherwise adopt or contribute, and signals "the maintainer can restrict this later" even though no
restriction was planned beyond the anti-resale clause. Apache 2.0 is OSI-approved, includes an explicit
patent grant (relevant here — telephony/codec-adjacent code carries more patent surface than typical web
app code), and is the standard choice for infrastructure projects that want real external contribution
(Kubernetes, most CNCF projects) as opposed to projects optimizing to prevent cloud-vendor resale at the
cost of community growth (n8n's actual tradeoff, made deliberately for their situation). At zero external
contributors and zero known forks today — the same condition that made ADR-018 cheap to make — this
reversal is equally cheap: no CLA, no consent needed, one commit.

The anti-competing-hosted-service goal from ADR-018 doesn't fully disappear; it's just solved with a
different mechanism. A permissive code license doesn't protect the *code* from being repackaged, but it was
never really the code that mattered for that concern — it's the name. Someone can already fork any Apache
2.0 project and run it as a service; what they can't do is call it "OpenVent" or use the OpenVent logo while
doing it, without that being a trademark violation. This is the same split Kubernetes, Docker, and (for
their core) Supabase actually rely on: permissive code + trademark control on the brand, not a custom
license restricting the code itself.

**Decision:**
- Replace `LICENSE` with the unmodified, canonical Apache License 2.0 text.
- Add a `NOTICE` file with the copyright line and a pointer to the trademark policy (standard Apache 2.0
  practice for projects that also want to flag trademark terms).
- Add `TRADEMARK.md` — plain-language policy: forking, self-hosting, and even commercial use of the code is
  fully permitted; naming a fork/hosted-service/product "OpenVent" (or confusingly similar) or using the
  logo in a way that implies official status is not, without permission.
- Update `packages/openvent-compliance/package.json`'s `license` field from `"SEE LICENSE IN ../../LICENSE"`
  to `"Apache-2.0"`.
- Update `README.md`'s License section to describe Apache 2.0 + the trademark carve-out, replacing the
  fair-code description.
- Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1) and `SECURITY.md` (private vulnerability reporting via
  GitHub Security Advisories) — didn't exist before; table stakes for a project actually asking for outside
  contribution.
- Add `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug report, feature request, config linking to Discussions) and
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — checklist mirrors the existing expectations already documented in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` (tests, typecheck, docs-in-same-PR, ADR entries for real decisions) so they're enforced
  at the PR template level, not just prose.
- Add a "Good places to start" section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and an "Open for contribution" section to
  `ROADMAP.md` listing concrete, scoped items (telephony abstraction, scoped required-field schemas, more
  integrations, local mock mode, docs gaps) that are wanted but not on the maintainer's active queue.

**Consequences:** All code contributed from this commit forward is Apache 2.0 — permissive, commercially
usable by anyone, including as a competing hosted service, which ADR-018 explicitly tried to prevent. That
tradeoff is accepted deliberately: the trademark policy is the actual mechanism protecting the "OpenVent"
name and brand equity now, not the code license. If a genuine premium/hosted layer gets built later (the
"OpenVent Cloud" from ADR-015), it can live as closed-source code calling the open core, or under a
separate license for just that layer — it does not require the core to be non-permissive. No functional
code changes in this round. Anyone relying on the code under the Sustainable Use License terms as it stood
before this commit keeps no different rights either way, since Apache 2.0 grants strictly more.

## ADR-029 — Strip Runable-scaffold leftovers: analytics beacon, dead template files, placeholder identifiers

**Date:** 2026-07-09

**Context:** The repo was originally scaffolded from Runable's internal managed-app template, and several
pieces of that scaffolding never got cleaned up as the project turned into a real, independent, public
open-source repo. A pass looking specifically for "things that shouldn't be in a public repo" turned up:

- A **third-party analytics beacon** (`packages/web/vite/plugins/runable-analytics-plugin.ts` +
  `packages/web/public/runable.js`) that a Vite plugin silently injected into every production build,
  sending every visitor's page views to `https://r.lilstts.com/events` (Runable's own collector,
  "onedollarstats" under the hood) with zero disclosure anywhere in the app, privacy policy, or docs. Same
  pattern existed in the mobile shell (`OneDollarStatsProvider` in `packages/mobile/app/_layout.tsx` +
  `packages/mobile/lib/analytics.ts`, `onedollarstats` npm dependency). For a project whose entire pitch is
  "compliance-first, self-hosted, read-the-code-and-trust-it" (TCPA/GDPR/HIPAA positioning throughout the
  landing page and docs), silently phoning a third-party analytics collector on every self-hosted deploy is
  a direct contradiction of the project's own stated values, not just an unused file.
- **`.runable/`** — Runable-platform-internal release-tracking tooling (`validate-releases.ts`,
  `releases.json`, its Zod schema) with no relevance to OpenVent as an independent project; wired into the
  `lint` npm script (`validate:releases`), so it ran on every contributor's machine and in CI for no reason
  a self-hoster or contributor could make sense of.
- **`package.json`'s `name` field** was still literally `"sandbox-app-template"` — the raw scaffold name,
  never renamed to `"openvent"`. Cosmetic, but exactly the kind of thing that undermines trust in a repo
  asking for outside contribution (ADR-028).
- **`.env.template`** — a second, unreferenced env-file template left over from the original scaffold,
  listing unrelated platform env vars (`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY`, `APPLICATION_ID`) that
  don't exist anywhere in OpenVent's actual code. `.env.example` is the real, accurate, already-documented
  one; the second file was pure confusion for anyone setting up a dev environment.
- **`packages/web/website.config.json`** still had `"name": "Runable"` and `"hostname": "xyz.runable.site"`
  — unfilled scaffold placeholders.
- **`packages/mobile/app.json`** had `"package"/"bundleIdentifier": "com.appId.runable"` (a literal,
  never-filled-in template placeholder) and a hardcoded `apiUrl` pointing at a dead internal Runable preview
  URL (`voiceag-1mf8gfp-preview-4200.runable.site`) plus a Runable-internal `applicationId` — none of it
  meaningful outside the original sandbox session it was generated in.
- Two landing-page copy spots (`faq.tsx`, `cta-footer.tsx`) still said "fair-code" / "OpenVent Sustainable
  Use License" after ADR-028 moved the project to Apache 2.0 — the license file changed but two prose
  mentions were missed in that round.

Removing the `.runable/`-wired `validate:releases` step also surfaced that the root `zod`/`semver`/
`@types/semver` devDependencies existed only to support that deleted tooling — `packages/web` already
depends on its own `zod` directly, so nothing else used the root copies.

Deleting the analytics plugin also exposed a latent, unrelated type-checking gap: six files
(`gohighlevel.ts`, `google-calendar.ts`, `hubspot.ts`, `salesforce.ts`, `hono-dev-plugin.ts`) were only
passing `tsc -b` because `jsdom`'s ambient types (pulled in only by the now-deleted plugin importing
`jsdom`) were incidentally providing a looser global `fetch`/`Request`/`Response` type than `bun-types`
actually defines on its own. With that incidental import gone, `tsc -b --force` correctly failed on `.json()`
calls typed as `{}`/`unknown` and a `new Request(url, ...)` call passed a `URL` instead of a `string`. These
were real, pre-existing gaps in the type coverage of those files, just masked by an accidental transitive
import — not something introduced by this cleanup, but only surfaced by it.

**Decision:**
- Delete the analytics plugin, its injected script, and the mobile `OneDollarStatsProvider` wiring +
  `onedollarstats` dependency entirely. No replacement telemetry added — if usage analytics are wanted
  later, they need to be an explicit, disclosed, opt-in choice documented in the privacy-relevant docs, not
  a silent build-time injection.
- Delete `.runable/` and the `validate:releases` step from `package.json`'s `lint` script.
- Rename `package.json`'s `name` to `"openvent"`; drop the now-unused `zod`/`semver`/`@types/semver` root
  devDependencies.
- Delete `.env.template`; `.env.example` remains the single source of truth for env setup.
- Fix `website.config.json` and `packages/mobile/app.json` placeholders to real OpenVent values
  (`dev.openvent.mobile` for bundle/package identifiers, no hardcoded stale preview URL —
  `packages/mobile/lib/api.ts` already falls back to `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` if the Expo config extra is
  empty).
- Fix the two stale "fair-code" mentions in landing-page copy to reflect Apache 2.0.
- Fix the six real type-checking gaps directly (`as any` casts on external API JSON responses in the four
  integration files — these are untyped third-party API bodies by nature, so a cast is the honest
  representation, not a workaround; `url.toString()` in `hono-dev-plugin.ts` so `Request`'s first argument
  matches its actual type; removed the now-unneeded `@ts-expect-error` on `duplex` since the overload
  resolves cleanly once the first argument is a plain string) rather than papering over them or
  reintroducing an incidental `jsdom` import just to keep the previous (accidental) type behavior.

**Consequences:** Verified via `tsc -b --force` (clean, no incremental-cache shortcuts), `vite build`
(clean — confirmed the built `dist/index.html` no longer contains any reference to the analytics script),
`bun run lint`/oxlint (0 warnings/errors), 55/55 web tests, 25/25 `@openvent/compliance` tests. Anyone
self-hosting OpenVent from this commit forward sends zero telemetry anywhere unless they explicitly wire up
their own. `packages/desktop`'s `package.json`/`app` naming (`@template/desktop`, etc.) and the mobile/
desktop packages' internal workspace names (`@template/web`, `@template/mobile`) were deliberately left
alone in this round — those are internal-only workspace package names never published or exposed to end
users, and renaming them touches every cross-package import; not worth the blast radius for a cosmetic-only
concern, unlike the public-facing identifiers and behavior fixed above.
