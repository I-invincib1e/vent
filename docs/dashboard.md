# Dashboard

A small operator dashboard ships at `/dashboard`, gated behind an admin key (entered once per browser
session, never sent anywhere but your own server) — either your `ADMIN_API_KEY` env var, or a labeled key
created from the Keys page (see below):

- **Calls** — live/completed calls, auto-refreshing, with a quick indicator of how many facts were
  captured per call
- **Call detail** — full transcript, tool-call log, recording link, the captured-state panel (see
  [State engine](./state-engine.md)), and a **latency breakdown** panel (STT connect, LLM
  time-to-first-token, TTS first byte — "not recorded" for fields that weren't captured, not a false
  `0ms`)
- **Do Not Call** — add/remove DNC entries without touching curl
- **Audit** — pull the compliance audit trail (who was called, when, under what consent, what was said)
  per call or per phone number, exportable as plain text or JSON
- **Keys** (`/dashboard/settings`) — generate labeled admin keys (shown once, copy button), see
  created/last-used timestamps, revoke individually — without rotating `ADMIN_API_KEY` for everyone

This is meant for you, the operator, not end users. It's not a full multi-tenant product login system,
but it's no longer just one shared secret either — see [`DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md) ADR-025 for the
labeled-key auth model.
