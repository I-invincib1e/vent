# Strategy synthesis — July 2026 feedback round

**Not a public doc — internal reasoning artifact.** Written after four rounds of real Reddit/LinkedIn
feedback plus direct competitive research (Voximplant). Purpose: turn accumulated signal into concrete
roadmap decisions instead of reacting to each comment individually. See `reddit-feedback.md` (gitignored,
not in this repo) for the raw comments this synthesizes.

## What we now know, in priority order

### 1. "Self-hosted" needed precision — fixed (ADR-016)
Multiple independent commenters correctly pushed back that Twilio/Deepgram/PSTN can't be self-hosted.
Resolved: Vent now describes itself as **self-hosted orchestration, bring-your-own AI providers** — a
three-tier spectrum (fully local ↔ Vent ↔ fully managed), not a binary claim. Shipped in docs, landing
page, and the agent's own persona. Closed.

### 2. Vendor lock-in is real architecture, wrong headline
Three independent sources (one neutral commenter, one self-disclosed adjacent-space builder, one
competitor co-founder) converged on the same point without prompting each other: **lock-in anxiety is
retroactive, not proactive.** Nobody shops for "no lock-in" before they've been burned by a price hike or
a breaking API change. This means:
- The architecture bet (swappable providers, own database) stays correct and valuable.
- It should stop being messaged as the headline pitch. It's the thing that makes migration a week instead
  of a rewrite when the bill spikes or the API breaks — insurance, not a hook.
- **Action:** when v2 launch copy is eventually written (still paused), lead with something else. Lock-in
  resistance becomes a supporting proof point, documented and real, not the opening line.

### 3. Compliance should ship as an audit trail, not more warnings
The single most concrete, buildable idea from any feedback round: produce, on demand, exactly who was
called, when, under what consent basis, what disposition, and what the agent said — assembled from data
Vent already collects (`calls`, `transcripts`, `doNotCall` tables) but never packaged as an exportable
artifact. Confirmed independently: "the people who've been close to a TCPA/DNC problem usually don't post
about it... produce that log on demand and you've handled most of the actual fear."
- **This is now the highest-priority concrete build item**, ahead of the integrations work that was
  previously "in progress." It's cheap (data already exists), differentiated (nobody else in the OSS
  conversation ships this), and directly answers the #1 fear identified in the original market research.

### 4. State engine — strongly, independently validated
Two separate people described nearly the identical design ("transcript as event log, separate canonical
state") without reading each other's comments or Vent's code. This is the strongest validation any single
piece of work has received. No action needed — already shipped (ADR-012) — but worth knowing this is a
genuinely defensible, not just internally-convinced-ourselves, design decision.

### 5. Latency visibility is a real, cheap, currently-unaddressed gap
From Talkif.ai (weighted as an interested party, but the technical claims check out against our own code):
Vent has exactly one latency measurement (LLM time-to-first-token, console-logged only) and nothing for
STT connect time, TTS first-byte time, or end-to-end round-trip. Cold-start doesn't apply to us (PM2 runs
persistent instances). Region-aware telephony is real but a much bigger, separate infra decision — not
scoping that now.
- **Action:** per-call latency breakdown (STT connect, first STT result, LLM TTFT, TTS first byte, total
  round-trip), surfaced on the dashboard's call detail page — not just console logs. Concrete, scoped,
  cheap relative to its diagnostic value.

### 6. Cross-call memory is a real, separate feature — not a competing solution
Voximplant (managed voice-AI orchestration platform, CPaaS) ships `ApplicationStorage` for cross-call
history: caller dials back next week, agent recalls roughly what was discussed last time via a rolling
raw-message-history array fed back into LLM context. Read carefully (docs reviewed directly, not just the
comment): this solves a **different problem** than Vent's state engine — it's fuzzy cross-call recall, not
deterministic within-call state, and its actual mechanism (raw chat-message history) is the same
"transcript as memory" pattern ADR-012 already identified as unreliable. Not a competing fix; a
complementary, currently-missing feature.
- **Action (lower priority, later):** cross-call memory (keyed by phone number, not caller-ID-as-identity
  since that's spoofable) as a genuinely separate addition on top of, not instead of, `capturedState`.

## Competitive positioning — what Voximplant's model tells us

Direct research into Voximplant (docs, pricing, architecture) confirms where Vent sits and sharpens the
"three-tier spectrum" framing from ADR-016:

- **Voximplant is a proprietary managed CPaaS + orchestration platform.** Scenarios (`VoxEngine`, their
  serverless JS runtime) execute on Voximplant's own cloud, not the customer's infrastructure. Their own
  FAQ explicitly discourages self-hosting their client library ("we don't recommend this... it is
  important to use the latest version"). This is a real, useful data point: even a technically sophisticated
  competitor with a real orchestration story is architecturally on the *fully-managed* end of our spectrum,
  not the middle. It validates that "self-hosted orchestration" is a genuinely distinct, non-trivial
  position — not a marketing spin on the same thing everyone else offers.
- **Their strength (worth taking seriously, not dismissing):** broad, well-documented multi-provider
  connectors (OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Ultravox, Cartesia, Deepgram, ElevenLabs all wired in with example
  code), multi-network telephony (PSTN, SIP, WhatsApp, WebRTC, native mobile), and a real cross-call memory
  primitive shipped as a documented pattern, not a stub. Their breadth of pre-built connectors is larger
  than Vent's today.
- **What they don't and structurally can't offer:** your own database owning the data, code you can read
  end-to-end and audit, compliance logic (DNC/TCPA/HIPAA/GDPR) built into the platform rather than left to
  the integrator, or the ability to self-host the orchestration layer itself. Their pricing ($0.004/min
  cited, plus whatever the underlying AI/telephony providers cost on top) is also a recurring per-minute
  fee with no self-hosted escape hatch — exactly the "vendor lock-in becomes a cost problem eventually"
  pattern three separate feedback sources flagged independently.

**Positioning conclusion:** Vent shouldn't compete with Voximplant on connector breadth (they have more
resources and a head start there) or on ease-of-setup (managed will always win that). Vent's differentiated
ground is: self-hosted orchestration + compliance-as-shipped-feature + auditability — none of which a
managed CPaaS can offer by definition, no matter how many connectors they add.

## Revised priority order for actual next work

Previously "in progress"/"next" items (integrations, resilience layer) are done. Revised order based on
this round's synthesis, replacing the stale "not started" section of `ROADMAP.md`:

1. **Compliance audit-trail export** (new, highest priority — concrete, cheap, most differentiated, most
   requested)
2. **Per-call latency breakdown on the dashboard** (concrete, cheap, closes a real diagnostic gap)
3. **Cross-call memory** (real, but lower priority — complements the state engine, not urgent)
4. **v2 messaging pass** — demote lock-in from headline to supporting proof point, once ready to write
   launch copy (still paused pending more signal, per user's original "accumulate before concluding" call)
5. **Continued community feedback loop** — keep accumulating; four rounds in and every single one has
   produced at least one concrete, buildable idea. No sign this is diminishing yet.

## What this round did NOT change
- Open-core model (ADR-015) — unaffected, still the direction.
- Self-hosted-orchestration positioning (ADR-016) — reinforced, not revised, by the Voximplant research.
- npm publish of `@vent/compliance` — still deferred, now arguably even more clearly the right call, since
  the audit-trail feature (below) will likely live in or alongside that package and should ship as part of
  a more complete compliance story, not before it.
