 * warning banner, it's being able to produce, on demand, exactly who was
 * called, when, under what consent basis, what disposition, and what the
 * agent said. Vent already collects all of this (calls, transcripts,
 * disposition, DNC status) — this module is the missing step that packages
 * it into a single exportable, audit-ready record instead of leaving an
 * operator to reconstruct it by hand from multiple tables under pressure
 * (e.g. during an actual regulatory inquiry).
 *
 * Framework-agnostic like the rest of this package — bring your own call-log
 * storage via CallAuditStorageAdapter (see storage.ts's CallLogStorageAdapter
 * for the sibling pattern this follows) and this module does the assembly
 * and formatting, not the persistence.
